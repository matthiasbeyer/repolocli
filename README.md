# repolocli

This repository is a WIP project to bring repology to the commandline.

There's a library under `./librepology/` and a commandline interface for
viewing repology data.


## Stability

This is alpha-quality software, use at your own risk.

MSRV: 1.42.0

As the repology.org API is [not stable](https://repology.org/api), this program
won't be stable for a long time. Still, 0.x.y releases may happen.
