## State of this project

This was a nice playground for developing against the repology.org API, but I
do not have time to develop it anymore. The repology API has changed, so this
does not work right now.

Though, If you want to submit patches, I am more than happy to review and
possibly include them!

There's a library under `./librepology/` and a commandline interface for
viewing repology data.

## Stability

This is alpha-quality software, use at your own risk.

As the repology.org API is [not stable](https://repology.org/api), this program
won't be stable for a long time. Still, 0.x.y releases may happen.
